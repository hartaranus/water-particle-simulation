# Study Focus
The study was focused on aquatic envronment pH maintenance analysis to prevent the hypoxia for the biotic components living in the ecosystem

# Intention of This Simulation
Mean-field particle simulation with self propelling algorithm was previously utilized to analyze the behavior of swarm microorganisms and to mimic the swarm behavior artificially such as swarm robots, swarm intelligence, etc. In this study, the technqiue was adopted to assess water system stability and confirm the molecular dynamics simulation results. The simulated particles were not representing the atom or the water molecule itself instead, it represents the molecule trajectories. The trajectory itself is the total interacting dipoles of the system.
